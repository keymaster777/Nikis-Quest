## Recent Updates
- Added Map of current level
- Added level completion criteria and progress tracking

- Added some scaling difficulty between levels
## What is a Chort?
- A tricky demonoid creature that waits for you to get close before rushing you while shreaking as loud as possible
## TO-DO
- Refactor the rest of the old JS code to use ES6
- Refactor Player, Monster, and Tile classes with composition to make boundary box behavior more flexible.
- Move UI code into an actual UI class with relative coordinates instead of hard coded in relation to the global canvas coordinates.
