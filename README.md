## Recent Updates

## TO-DO
- Refactor the rest of the old JS code to use ES6
- Add map to UI to track 'discovered' rooms
- Add "level completion" criteria and scaling difficulty between levels
- Refactor Player, Monster, and Tile classes with composition to make boundary box behavior more flexible.
- Move UI code into an actual UI class with relative coordinates instead of hard coded in relation to the global canvas coordinates.
- Add **the sound of silence** as a rare message in rooms
